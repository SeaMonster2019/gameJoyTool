# gameJoyTool
This is a  joypad tool that allows you to program your phone's controller to control your computer. 
This program is written using "qt c++" and "qt qml".

This program already has most of the functions, including "communication" and "control", but there are still flaws.
I used the "win32 API" for this program, so the control may fail in some games. I am trying other methods.
